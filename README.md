# React Redux Example

This is a project that steps through what react-redux does.  This piggy-backs off of the explanations in the [vanilla redux example](https://github.com/cwadrupldijjit/vanilla-redux-example) I set up previously.

The bulk of the explanation of what it's doing is found inside of the files themselves.  To start looking through it, go to the `redux.js` file in the `src` directory.

## Setting up:
 - Clone this repository

## Installing:
 - `npm i`

## Starting up:
 - `npm start`

## Using it:
Open the browser to http://localhost:3000 (if it doesn't automatically open).  Click on either button and watch the counter (which is coming from the redux state) change depending on which button you push.
